The purpose of the program is to register students and manage their details such as enrolling in courses and paying balances. 
The program would also allow administrators to view a list of students, courses, and the courses a student is registered to. 


The user can interact with the program by inputting the correct numerical value for the option listed in the Main Menu. 
The user will see 9 different options to navigate the program. 
Each option executes a specific functionality of the program.


Limitations of the program would be the lack of a database to structure the information that is stored. 
When running the program and entering information, the information will be temporarily stored in memory until the program stops. 
Hence, the information will be unretainable. In addition, students and course records cannot be removed from the Registration System. 


User will find it more complicated to interact with the program using a command line interface as opposed to using Graphic User Interface (GUI). 
It is assumed that user will enter an incorrect input where required, for example they may enter a number not listed in the Main Menu which will result in the error "Please enter a valid selection!". 
It is assumed that the user will input a string where an integer is required.
